# AI Tool Usage Disclosure

## Tools Used

**ChatGPT (OpenAI)**  
Used to assist with:

- Code generation (visualizations, exports, data processing)  
- Structuring modular scripts  
- Explaining technical concepts  
- Debugging assistance and suggestions  

## Significant Contributions

### Code for statistical analysis and visualizations  
ChatGPT provided initial structures and template code for various data visualizations (histograms, boxplots, geographical maps, etc.).  
I integrated this code into my project, customized it for my specific dataset, and thoroughly tested and adapted each script.

### Export automation for figures and tables  
I requested code to automate the export of figures and statistical tables in multiple formats (.csv, .pdf, .tex).  
The implementation was modified by me to comply with the project’s directory structure and formatting standards.

### Project structure and orchestration  
ChatGPT proposed ideas for organizing the codebase (e.g., using a main script to orchestrate all processing and visualizations).  
I refined this structure and ensured all components worked together consistently.

### Testing and verification  
Some test cases were partially generated with AI assistance, then manually reviewed, adjusted, and validated by me.


### Support for documentation and writing

ChatGPT was also used to help draft and refine some parts of the README
and to suggest wording for technical explanations. All final text was
revised, edited, and validated by me to ensure accuracy, coherence, and
consistency with the actual analyses.

## Learning and Supervision

I used AI support to better understand data cleaning workflows, plotting techniques, and best practices for modular code in Python.  

I actively participated in all decisions: naming conventions, figure aesthetics, file organization, and functional logic.  

I identified and resolved export-related issues (e.g., layout, labels, encoding) myself.  

The AI was used strictly as a support tool; every generated output was reviewed, corrected, or adapted under my supervision.

## Reliability and limitations

I am aware that AI tools can generate incorrect, incomplete, or
non-idiomatic code. For this reason, all code suggested by ChatGPT was:

- executed and debugged by me,
- adapted to the actual dataset and project constraints,
- covered by manual checks and, when relevant, pytest tests.

The final pipeline, models, and visualisations are the result of this
iterative verification process, not a direct copy-paste of AI output.
    
## Clarifications

I fully understand the content and logic of the code submitted.  

The project reflects my independent work and critical thinking, with AI support used responsibly and transparently.  

All conceptual choices, analysis directions, and interpretations were made by me.
