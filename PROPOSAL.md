# Predicting Anxiety Levels from Survey Data

**Category**: Data Analysis & Visualization / Mental Health Analytics

Among the most common and destabilizing mental health disorders, anxiety disorders affect approximately a hundred million people worldwide. Although these disorders have effective treatments already available, too many people are not diagnosed or do not receive sufficient support. This project aims to explore how personal characteristics and psychometric models are related to self-reported anxiety levels, using survey data from the open DASS (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales) dataset. More specifically, we seek to model anxiety scores and identify the main predictors through data analysis and machine learning.

The method used in this study will be Python to process the DASS dataset (~39,000 responses) which contains scores on depression, stress, and anxiety items, as well as demographic characteristics. After preprocessing the data (cleaning, coding, filtering), we will train predictive models such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests to estimate anxiety levels based on other variables. The main objective then will be to identify characteristics such as: age, sex, other symptoms of stress/depression, which best predict a high anxiety score.

The results will be presented in a notebook containing visualizations like, score distributions, feature importance graphs. And model evaluation metrics like : accuracy, F1 score. Finally, if time permits, there would be the possibility to explore additional models or add interpretation tools such as SHAP to better understand the model’s decisions.

The study's challenges include managing missing values, balancing class distributions, and responsibly interpreting the results. This can be remedied by using thorough data cleaning and validation techniques.

Finally, this project aims to combine statistical rigor with social relevance by applying machine learning to an impactful issue in mental health, while demonstrating solid programming and data science practices.
